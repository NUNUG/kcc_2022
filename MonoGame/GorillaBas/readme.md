## About The Project
### People
The program, graphics, sounds, music, maps, documentation and teaching curriculum were created by Phil Gilmore.

### Tools
These are the tools that were used to create the game.
- Visual Studio 2022
- Paint.NET
- Audacity
- git

These are the tools you will need for the class:
- Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition or greater


## Building the Project
Once you've cloned the repository, you should be able to build the solution in Visual Studio 2022.  All dependencies are NuGet packages or at included in the Git reposiory, so no other downloads should be necessary.

## Sound
I used Audacity and a microphone to create all the sound effects.  I didn't download any from the internet.  I did them all with my mouth and then edited them. Under no circumstances do you have to pay for sound effects if you don't want to.

Sounds effects are saved as 16-bit PCM wave files.

## Playing The Game

### Game Play
This is a two-player game.  Players take turns.  On each turn, the player must use the arrow keys to adjust their angle and velocity.  When the space bar is pressed, the gorilla will throw a bananabomb in the specified direction.  If the banana hits the opposing gorilla, that player wins the round.
